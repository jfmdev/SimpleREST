# Simple REST

This project is a sample application for showing how to implement a simple REST API using _Python_ and _Flask_.

> This project is also implemented using [Python & CherryPy](https://github.com/jfmdev/SimpleREST/tree/cherrypy) and using [JavaScript & Express](https://github.com/jfmdev/SimpleREST/tree/express).

## Requirements

The software was developed using **Python** and **Flask**, so you need:

 * Install _Python 3.6_ in your machine (if not already installed).
 * Install the _Flask_ dependency (which can be done with the command `pip install Flask`, after installing Python).
 
## Execution

In order to run the software, you must execute the command `python main.py` (inside the project's folder),
and then open the URL [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.
